[Single Element CSS Spinners](http://projects.lukehaas.me/css-loaders)
============

This is a collection of loading spinners animated with CSS.

Each spinner consists of a single div with a class of 'loader' and content text of 'Loading...'.
The text is for screen readers and can be used as a fallback state for older browsers.

The aim of this project was to create a set of minimal loading spinners that are visually appealing and also convey their intended meaning.

A strict limit of one element per loader (not including pseudo-elements) was placed on this project based on the belief that something as simple as a loader doesn't deserve more.

Each loader is given a font size in pixels and all other sizes are in ems so to change the size of a loader, just adjust the font-size.
